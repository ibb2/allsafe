                        urgent, or convincing. These words are designed to trick

                        In 2024, the top 5 scams alone accounted for

                        scams with young adults. Among these years, investment
                        scams have the highest financial impact, making up 50.4%
                        of the total losses, followed by dating and romance
                        scams, which account for around 17.4%.
